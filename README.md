# Hi, I'm Johnny 👋

Currently a Front End Developer @ MEO Studio crafting intuitive, polished digital experiences with a focus on detail and user-centered design.

Just a heads-up, most of my coding activity happens in private GitLab repos at work, so I’m not very active on GitHub.

### What I am doing now 🧑‍💻:

- 🔭 I’m currently diving deeper into deployment tooling—specifically containerization with Docker and managing Linux-based server environments. Also focusing on unit and integration testing for reliable frontend.
- ✨ Currently working full-time as a front-end developer.
- 🌏 Contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johchai/)

### Tools & Languages used ⚙️ :

Key areas of work include front-end development with React and Next.js, integrating REST APIs, building 3D interfaces with Three.js, managing content with Strapi, and using Docker for containerization.
